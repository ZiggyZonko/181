**🎨 Background**

181 or µ is a simple Rust Web Scraper that uses Reqwest and html parsing to scrape the desired website of it's content. For this example I have used a default website for this scrape but you can use any website you want. The output goes into the ```products.csv``` file and is organised of the link, the size of the image, name and price. Before Running you may need to delete the already existing products.csv file and teh code will automatically replace the file for you.

**⚒️ Requirements**

The requirements for this project require a few things and some of them need setting up on your local device. The programming language used here is Rust so you would need to install rust. You may visit this website to help you install it your version of Rust: 
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install. This website automatically detects your system and will most likely give the right command to start off with. If this is not the case you should got to the other installation page and some instructions are located there.
Another thing you might need is a C/C++ Compilier. As Rust Runs off a C/C++ Compiler you will need it to compile all of your code in Rust. You can check if you have rust installed by running: ```rustup --version```. You may also want to install Rust's terminal helper, cargo.
Cargo makes it easier to generate new projects and is very helpful for an IDE such as VS Code as there is not built in Compilier for rust.

👋 This should be all to run your very own Web Scraper with the Rust Programming Language. Please, Feel Free to report any error to the issues page of this repository. 👋
